# 📊 Statistical Techniques – Business Insights from Real-World Data

This repository presents a series of applied statistical analyses across three real-world datasets, using techniques such as regression, ANOVA, clustering, and non-parametric testing. These analyses were conducted as part of a Master's program in Big Data Analytics.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **📄 Report**: [`Statistical-Techniques.pdf`](./Statistical-Techniques.pdf) – Full report of findings and methodology.
- **📄 R Markdown**: [`Statistical Techniques.Rmd`](./Statistical%20Techniques.Rmd) – Source code with statistical models and visualizations.

## 🧠 Executive Summary

This project explores three distinct business questions using statistical methods:

1. **🛒 E-Commerce Pricing Strategy**  
   *Finding:* Discounts do **not** significantly impact final prices.  
   *Method:* Correlation, Regression, ANOVA, Seasonal Analysis.

2. **📚 Consumer Behavior in Online Book Reviews**
